# LESSON 8 HOMEWORK QUESTIONS

# 1. Printing the Return Value of a Function Without a return Statement

def example_function():
    pass

result = example_function()
print(result)

# OUTPUT
# NONE


# 2. Printing the Return Value of a Function with return None

# 3. Similarities Between break and return

# Similarity:
# •	Both break and return immediately stop the current flow of execution.
# •	break stops the loop.
# •	return stops the function.
# •	In both cases, the execution continues from the point right after the loop or the function call.
